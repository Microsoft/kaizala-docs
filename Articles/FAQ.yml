      - question: |
          How do I ensure that expiry of refreshToken doesn't stop the connection between Kaizala and my system/app
        answer: |
          Generally Refresh Token expires after 365 days. In order to allow 3rd party systems to maintain the connection even when refreshToken is about to expire, Kaizala sends new Refresh Token with every Access Token calls since 90% of the validity of the refresh Token is reached. Hence system should be able to read this refreshToken and use this refreshToken for subsequent accessTokens. [Read more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/kaizala/connectors/tokens)
          
      - question: |
          How do I create a group using API?
        answer: |
          Kaizala allows creation of groups & sub-groups using APIs. Read more to [create a group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/kaizala/connectors/groups). 
          
          > [!NOTE]
          > If you are using User Level Refresh Token, new group will be created. But if group level token is used to create a group, a sub-group for the concerned group is created.

      - question: |
          How can we add a member to a group through Kaizala APIs?
        answer: |
          Kaizala exposes API to add members in a group. Get more details [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/kaizala/connectors/members).     To make a group member an admin, refer below sample: 
          
          ````  
          PUT {endpoint-url}/v1/groups/{groupId}/members/{memberId} 
          
          Header: 
          accessToken 
          
          Body 
          {"role":"Admin"} 
          ````
          
      - question: |
          Is it possible to create a webhook which can notify on group creation?
        answer: |
          It is not possible to create a webhook to get notifications on group creations because all webhooks currently operate within the context of a group. Within the context of a group you can create webhooks to get notifications on messages/actions that are sent/received, member addition and deletion, etc.  
          
          
      - question: |
          Do connectors have to be added manually to every group?
        answer: |
          If the connector is created from Tenant Admin, then you do not have to add the connector manually to every group. 
          
          
          
      - question: |
          How can I fetch complete responses of all participants in a Survey?

          Headers: 
          accessToken : {{access-token}} 
          ```` 
          
          
      - question: |
          Can I send a message in a 1-1 conversation in Kaizala through APIs?  All APIs in Kaizala operate within the context of a group. So it is not possible to send a message in a 1-1 conversation using an API. Following capabilities are supported:
        answer: |
          -   Sending message to a particular subscriber in a public group 
          -   Creating a group with the user and sending message to the group
          
          
          
      - question: |
          Is it possible to send a message only to particular member in a group?
        answer: |
          Only in the case of a public group it is possible to send a message to particular subscriber. In a normal group this is not possible.
